This achievement holds special significance for me as it represents years of dedication, growth, and relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p><p>A valuable lesson I&#39;ve learned during my college years is the importance of patience, as the saying goes, &quot;It&#39;s a journey, not a marathon.&quot;</p><p>While this sentiment might seem clich√©, it became my guiding principle during the latter part of my college journey, particularly as I worked on my thesis. Although I had expected to graduate a year earlier, I faced a delay of over a year due to challenges with my thesis. By then, most of my batchmates had already graduated, and I found myself in a position where I was still working on my thesis.</p><p>During the first thesis defense, I neither passed nor failed. We were granted two academic terms to complete all necessary revisions before progressing to Thesis-2 (referred to as ISPROJ-2 in our curriculum), which covers chapters 4 and 5, along with the final thesis product‚Äîa website in our case.</p><p>Although the revisions could have been completed within one term, I found myself falling into a period of laziness. But more than just laziness, I intended to deliberately delay taking Thesis-2.</p><p>First, the delay gave me time to prepare for Thesis-2. With an end product requirement of a website at this stage, I could thoroughly explore, study, and select various tools that I could use for the end product, thereby avoiding last-minute experimentation during the actual Thesis-2 semester.</p><p>Secondly, due to my delay, the majority of my batchmates had already completed their Thesis-2 defenses. This allowed me to request their outputs, which served as a guide as I constructed my Thesis-2 output.</p><p>Additionally, I obtained a spreadsheet from over five groups detailing the feedback and revisions suggested by their panelists. This gave me a head start in understanding the changes panelists were seeking, giving me an initial idea of the questions they ask and areas they emphasize. As a result, I had the chance to work on my Thesis-2 output several months before the actual semester began, ensuring I had enough time to incorporate all the notes taken from other groups into my output.</p><p>This led to receiving good feedback from our panelists, which was music to my ears, considering how it turned into a heated discussion during the first thesis defense. As a result, the thesis was nominated for the ‚Äúbest capstone‚Äù award and eventually won it.</p><p>Now, as I step into this new chapter, I am excited to leverage the skills and insights gained during my college years. Heartfelt gratitude to my professors, peers, friends, and family, who have been my pillars of support. Here&#39;s to embracing the future with enthusiasm and the determination to make a positive impact! üåüüöÄ</p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Graduation Pic 1"><br><br><img src="'+o+'" alt="Graduation Pic 2"><br><br><img src="'+r+'" alt="Graduation Pic 3">',17),l=[d];function h(c,u,m,p,g,f){return t(),a("div",null,l)}const b=e(n,[["render",h]]);export{w as __pageData,b as default};
