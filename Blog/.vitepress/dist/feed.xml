            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Why write the annual summary at this time?</h3>
<p>The company's fiscal year is based on March of each year. At present, most of my energy is devoted to work, so the company's year is just like my year.</p>
<h3>About work.</h3>
<p>In January 2022, our entire department received a layoff letter and I had to leave an online education company. After two months of job hunting, I received offers from several companies, including some big traditional web2 companies, and of course my current company, okx.</p>
<p>After failing at an online education company, I learned how to choose a good company, it's simple, it has to make money or have strong profit expectations.</p>
<p>So, without much hesitation, I went to okx and refused other offers, even though the salary at okx was not the best.</p>
<p>After working at okx for a year, I have grown from a dapp beginner to an expert.</p>
<p>At the end of this year, I received S in the Performance Evaluation, which made me excited all night.</p>
<h3>About Interest Development</h3>
<p>There is always a special feeling when developing your own projects, and I call this feeling interest development.</p>
<p>This year, I spend most of my spare time on my blog themes, which help me receive more than 100 stars. It's really interesting.</p>
<p>I also submitted PR to some open source projects, mostly to fix bugs. I didn't intend to submit PR to any project, I don't like the feeling of intentional work.</p>
<p>I found that if you want to go deep into an open source project, you have to join the dev team and communicate with them in-depth, otherwise, the code will be submitted haphazardly while wasting your time, but also consuming the maintenance team's experience to review.</p>
<p>Apparently, I don't have much time to participate in the open source community communication at the moment, so everything I do at the moment is a matter of interest, most of them are bug fixes that do not affect the main architecture.</p>
<p>Maybe someday, when I'm not so busy with work, I can spend more time on open source projects.</p>
<h3>About Life</h3>
<p>This year I went to Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiangsu, Tianjin, and Hebei with my girlfriend. I am happy.</p>
<h3>About money management</h3>
<p>My main financial tools this year are bank deposits, money funds, and Bitcoin spots. My investment approach is conservative, but I still get more than 20% returns. Most of them come from Bitcoin. Of course, I've liquidated my position now, maybe I'll buy when Bitcoin goes down again.</p>
<p>Next year I plan to buy some stocks and ETH spots. Although they will not account for much, because high returns will also assume high risk, my goal is 8% APY, that's enough for me.</p>
