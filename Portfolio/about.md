# About me

## Who am I ?

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Simon Pangan, a recent graduate eagerly seeking exciting opportunities in web development. My passion lies in working with Laravel, Vue.js, and MySQL as my primary tech stack. I've been using these technologies since 2019, with Laravel version 6, Vue version 2, and MySQL version 8.

## What do I do ?
Over the past few years, I have been involved in several noteworthy programming projects, with the most significant ones being [CharitAble](/projects/charitAble), which won the Best Capstone Award and [Inflow](/projects/inflow). While I won't delve into the details here, you can find more about these projects in the [projects section](/projects/) of my portfolio.

In addition to my project work, I am also a freelance developer, working on various small to medium-sized projects. One aspect I particularly enjoy is collaborating with students from different schools to create their thesis or final projects. It's rewarding to be part of academic journey and contribute to their success.

It's worth noting that some of my freelance projects are not listed in the projects section due to privacy reasons. I respect the confidentiality of the clients I work with, and ensuring their data  private is of utmost importance to me.
## What do I like?

Apart from the Vue.JS, I also have an interest in using React. Although I find Vue.js easier to work with and prefer using it for most projects. I'm open to exploring other technologies and frameworks. In fact, I plan to study the .NET framework in the future to expand my skill set.

Beyond programming, I find joy in watching sports, particularly basketball and table tennis. I am a passionate supporter of the OKC Thunder in the NBA and the San Miguel Beermen in the PBA. Table tennis holds a special place in my heart, and I greatly admire the playing style of Jun Mizutani. Additionally, I enjoy spending time playing video games, and lately, I've been quite immersed in COD Warzone.
