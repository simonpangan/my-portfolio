The project is based on the following technologies :</p><ul><li><a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Laravel</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://xstate.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>XState</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>React.JS</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Ant Design</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://inertiajs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Inertia</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://ably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Websockets via Ably</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="problem" tabindex="-1">Problem <a class="header-anchor" href="#problem" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Problem&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Interactive questions and answers can be managed using tools like Google Forms or Kahoot. However, these technologies come with a drawback: they don&#39;t allow the facilitator to show the next question based on the most popular answer from the current question. This limitation led to the development of Bandersnatch, a solution aimed at providing interactive theater experiences for production design students at Benilde. Bandersnatch empowers the audience by letting them pick the next scenario they&#39;d like to see. This effectively addresses the issue posed by existing technologies and significantly enriches the interactive nature of theater participation.</p><h2 id="sample" tabindex="-1">Sample <a class="header-anchor" href="#sample" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sample&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Below are screenshots of the final output:</p>',8),f={align:"center"},b=["src","alt"],_=n("br",null,null,-1),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"Bandersnatch","description":"","frontmatter":{"theme":"page"},"headers":[],"relativePath":"projects/bandersnatch.md","filePath":"projects/bandersnatch.md"}'),w={name:"projects/bandersnatch.md"},y=Object.assign(w,{setup(q){const s=o([{src:"home",alt:"Bandersnatch landing Page",title:"landing page"},{src:"password",alt:"Bandersnatch Audience Password",title:"audience login"},{src:"waiting",alt:"Bandersnatch Audience Waiting for the admin to start",title:"audience waiting for the admin to start the questions"},{src:"questions",alt:"Bandersnatch Sample Question",title:"sample question"},{src:"questions-done",alt:"Bandersnatch After Answering",title:"after answering"},{src:"end",alt:"Bandersnatch Audience Password",title:"end page after the questions"},{src:"admin-login",alt:"Bandersnatch admin login",title:"admin login"},{src:"admin-start",alt:"Bandersnatch admin start",title:"admin landing page"},{src:"admin-question",alt:"Bandersnatch sample question",title:"admin sample question"},{src:"admin-questions-with-prev",alt:"Bandersnatch Question with prev button",title:"admin sample question with previous button"},{src:"admin-done",alt:"Bandersnatch admin login",title:"admin end page after questions"}]);return(v,B)=>{const i=d("center");return t(),a("div",null,[m,(t(!0),a(r,null,l(s.value,e=>(t(),a(r,null,[n("div",f,[n("img",{src:`../assets/img/bandersnatch/${e.src}.png`,alt:e.alt,style:{width:"100%"}},null,8,b)]),h(i,null,{default:u(()=>[g(" ("+p(e.title)+") ",1)]),_:2},1024),_],64))),256))])}}});export{x as __pageData,y as default};
