My passion lies in working with Laravel, Vue.js, and MySQL as my primary tech stack. I&#39;ve been using these technologies since 2019, with Laravel version 6, Vue version 2, and MySQL version 8.</p><h2 id="what-do-i-do" tabindex="-1">What do I do ? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-i-do" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What do I do ?&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Over the past few years, I have been involved in several noteworthy programming projects, with the most significant ones being <a href="/projects/charitAble.html">CharitAble</a>, which won the Best Capstone Award and <a href="/projects/pocketbook-agency.html">Pocketbook Agency</a>. While I won&#39;t delve into the details here, you can find more about these projects in the <a href="/projects/">projects section</a> of my portfolio.</p><p>In addition to my project work, I am also a <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0162c159bac7e4a53b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">freelance developer</a>, working on various small to medium-sized projects. One aspect I particularly enjoy is collaborating with students from different schools to create their thesis or final projects. It&#39;s rewarding to be part of academic journey and contribute to their success.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that some of my freelance projects are not listed in the projects section due to privacy reasons. I respect the confidentiality of the clients I work with, and ensuring their data private is of utmost importance to me.</p><h2 id="what-do-i-like" tabindex="-1">What do I like? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-i-like" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What do I like?&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Apart from the Vue.JS, I also have an interest in using React. Although I find Vue.js easier to work with and prefer using it for most projects. I&#39;m open to exploring other technologies and frameworks. In fact, I plan to study the .NET framework more in the future to expand my skill set.</p><p>Beyond programming, I find joy in watching sports, particularly basketball and table tennis. I am a passionate supporter of the OKC Thunder in the NBA and the San Miguel Beermen in the PBA. Table tennis holds a special place in my heart, and I greatly admire the playing style of Jun Mizutani. Additionally, I enjoy spending time playing video games, and lately, I&#39;ve been quite immersed in COD Warzone.</p><h2 id="how-to-reach-me" tabindex="-1">How to reach me ? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-reach-me" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to reach me ?&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>If you&#39;d like to connect or discuss potential opportunities, feel free to reach out to me via email at <a href="mailto:simonjoseph.pangan@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">simonjoseph.pangan@gmail.com</a> or through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonpangan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>',12),i=[n];function s(h,l,c,d,p,m){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const b=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
