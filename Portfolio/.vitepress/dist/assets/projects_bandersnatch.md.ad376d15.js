The project is currently in development and has not yet been completed. The project is based on the following technologies :</p><ul><li><a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Laravel</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>React.JS</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Ant Design</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://inertiajs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Inertia</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://ably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Websockets via Ably</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="problem" tabindex="-1">Problem <a class="header-anchor" href="#problem" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Problem&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Interactive questions and answers can be managed using tools like Google Forms or Kahoot. However, these technologies come with a drawback: they don&#39;t allow the facilitator to show the next question based on the most popular answer from the current question. This limitation led to the development of Bandersnatch, a solution aimed at providing interactive theater experiences for production design students at Benilde. Bandersnatch empowers the audience by letting them pick the next scenario they&#39;d like to see. This effectively addresses the issue posed by existing technologies and significantly enriches the interactive nature of theater participation.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Update coming soon...</p><h2 id="sample" tabindex="-1">Sample <a class="header-anchor" href="#sample" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sample&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Below, you will find a snapshot of the project&#39;s current status.
