Our study is supported by research conducted by Fidelity Charitable in 2016, which revealed that two-thirds of Americans who have donated to charities want to give more, but they encounter various barriers in their giving experiences. Among the primary concerns raised by donors, 81 percent worry about nonprofit transparency and understanding the impact of their donations. They seek information about a nonprofit&#39;s credibility and how their philanthropic contributions will be utilized. Additionally, financial resources significantly influence donors&#39; decisions, with three-quarters expressing concerns about how their giving might impact their future financial situation and how much they should set aside for unforeseen personal needs. As a result, over 80% of donors are worried about how their donations will be used and if they will truly make a difference (Fidelity Charitable, 2016).</p><p>Furthermore, a significant number of donors have raised concerns regarding the way nonprofits engage with them, especially in terms of constant donation solicitations and the lack of recognition for their contributions. These findings reinforce the importance of adhering to best practices within the charitable sector, particularly concerning donor communication and database management. It is crucial for nonprofits to ensure effective donor engagement strategies to enhance donors&#39; willingness to give. Failure to do so could potentially hinder the organization&#39;s ability to raise funds in the future (Fidelity Charitable, 2016).</p><p>Ms. Twyla Raros David, Regional Project Manager of Handicap International Federation, points out that transparency issues stem from both technological and human resource perspectives. Donors wish to witness the consequences or effects of their donations to know the impact they have made Unfortunately, many non-government organizations, particularly small-scale ones, lack the budget and expertise to create tools and gather data that would enable monitoring and evaluation of their impact (Angeles et al., 2022).</p><p>Additionally, Ms. Aysha Iftikhar, Founder of Aspin Academy, emphasizes that the problem begins when charity/non-profit organizations fail to publicly display donations, irrespective of the amount. She believes that every donor should feel impactful and appreciated for their contributions, and the lack of such display creates transparency issues, leaving donors feeling uneasy and unrecognized for their efforts (Angeles et al., 2022).</p><p>The lack of information among donors is also evident in the Fidelity Charitable study, as some donors express difficulty finding new nonprofits to support or show interest in doing so. This suggests that donors are primarily interested in better ways to assess their charitable impact by obtaining more information from the groups they presently support. By addressing these concerns and enhancing communication among existing donors, nonprofits may be able to increase levels of support (Fidelity Charitable, 2016).</p><h2 id="solution" tabindex="-1">Solution <a class="header-anchor" href="#solution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Solution&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To address the problems, the academic project “CharitAble” was developed.
