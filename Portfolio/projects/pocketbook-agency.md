# [Pocketbook Agency](https://www.pocketbookagency.com/)

Pocketbook Agency, which is a modern recruiting firm, is one of the clients of my current company.

## Contributions 

- Lead maintainer of the application, responsible for promptly addressing bugs and implementing requested features.
- Developed and implemented the Press, and Blog Page features, enhancing the functionality and user experience of the project.
- Recreated the Job List page, originally developed by previous developers, to enhance performance, structure the application more effectively for easier maintenance, and incorporate modern technologies.
- Optimized the performance of the Job List Page, reducing the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) loading time from [23 seconds](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GIUaKjNvQ6lKgBPv1erAI7VPLld6FpA7/view?usp=sharing)  to [935 milliseconds](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZUS89G3S7Oi3kCKiyBUYlBgz1lAk9Brz/view?usp=sharing) by implementing industry best practices.
- Integrated the WordPress app with the Bullhorn API, enabling potential applicants to submit their applications.

## Technologies

For the project, I leveraged my knowledge in the following: 

- [**WordPress**](https://wordpress.org/): The main technology used for the project.
- [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/): Solely employed on the job list page, seamlessly connected to the WordPress app via iFrame.
- [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/): Utilized for the design of the job list page.
- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com/): Implemented in every page of the app.
- [**Bullhorn API**](https://www.bullhorn.com/): Integrated into the job application functionality on the job list page.
