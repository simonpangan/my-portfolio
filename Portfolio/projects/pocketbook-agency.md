## About


This project was created as part of the IS Capstone Project requirement, with the primary goal of developing a web application that removes benefactors' barriers to charitable giving, such as transparency, lack of information, and interaction. The project earned the Best Capstone Award for its accomplishments. 

POCKETBOOK AGENCY IS A MODERN RECRUITING FIRM BUILT FOR THE NEEDS OF TODAY, AND ANTICIPATES THE DEMANDS OF TOMORROW. WEâ€™RE PROUD TO CONTINUOUSLY SERVE CLIENTS IN THE FOLLOWING INDUSTRIES:

In order to do so, the following are the technologies I used for the project:

- [**Wordpress**](https://wordpress.org/)
- [**Next.JS**](https://nextjs.org/)
- [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com/)	
- [**Bullhorn API**](https://www.bullhorn.com/)
